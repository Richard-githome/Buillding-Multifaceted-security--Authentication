>>>>> :Hey Techie, good day (check this little app assessment out).

Please, this little project is testing my backend level of proficiency (not necessarily frontend).

Firstly, this is a nodejs (javascript) application.
Also, integrated EJS for templating.

The user to this application has to register/login either by inputting personal details or social media (Facebook/Google) IDs.
For the social media authentication, i used Passport-Oauth2.
